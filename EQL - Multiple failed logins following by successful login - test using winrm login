# EQL – Multiple Failed Logins Followed by Successful Login – Test

## Scenario Tested
I tested an EQL rule designed to detect multiple failed logins immediately followed by a successful login. The goal was to simulate suspicious login behavior similar to a brute-force attempt.  

- **Source:** Windows Event Logs (Security logs)  
- **Machines Tested:** Windows 11 endpoints (2 test machines)  
- **Accounts Used:** One standard user account  

I triggered several failed login attempts on the test account and then completed a successful login to see if the rule would pick up the pattern.

## Event Logs Observed
- **Event ID 4625:** Failed login attempts captured, including source IP, username, and failure reason.  
- **Event ID 4624:** Successful login event following the failed attempts.  
- The EQL rule correlated these events to detect the “failed → successful login” pattern.

### Example Event Log Snippets
```text
4625 | Account: TestUser | Failure Reason: Wrong password | Machine: WIN11-TEST1
4625 | Account: TestUser | Failure Reason: Wrong password | Machine: WIN11-TEST1
4624 | Account: TestUser | Success | Machine: WIN11-TEST1
